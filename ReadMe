1. hard to implement
   Rotate List
   WildCard Matching: Time Limit Exceeded
   ZigZag Conversion
2. beautiful algorithm
   Jump GameII: I find a good algorithm
3.Hard Problem
  WildCard Matching (try twice and fail)  Time Limit
  Surrounded Region(Big data- runtime error)

4. Recursion
   Flatten binary Tree to Linked List (Follow UP: If we don't use recursion?)

5 need to print 
  Minimum Window Substring

6 Serious Mistake 
  Median of Two Sorted Array.
