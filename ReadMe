1. hard to implement
   Rotate List
   WildCard Matching: Time Limit Exceeded
   ZigZag Conversion
   Longest Palindrome Substring
2. beautiful algorithm
   Jump GameII: I find a good algorithm
   Longest Valid Parentheses!!
   Decode Ways (recursion and Dynamic Programming)
3.Hard Problem
  WildCard Matching (try twice and fail)  Time Limit
  Surrounded Region(Big data- runtime error)
  Subsets
4. Recursion
   Flatten binary Tree to Linked List (Follow UP: If we don't use recursion?)

5 need to print 
  Minimum Window Substring

6 Serious Mistake 
  Median of Two Sorted Array.

7. Backtrack 
   Unique Binary Search Tree
   Word Search 
8 error-prone
  PathSum
  Reverse Linked List II
  Generate Parenthesis
  Construct Binary Tree from inorder and postorder 
9. incorrect 
   WildCard Matching
10 Code Beautiful
   Word Search
   Search the rotated Array II
   Level Order
11 Dynamic Programmin
    minimum path sum(try compress the space)
